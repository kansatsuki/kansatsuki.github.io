<h3><u>Japanese Newspaper</u></h3>
<p>Every morning a person on a motorbike delievers a local newspaper 河北新報 [Kahoku-shimpō] to the place where I live. Manager of the building takes it out of the plastic wrapping and hangs it on a special metal tube in the hall. I've never seen anyone read the daily newspaper, so I decided to be the first one (at least that day.)</p>
<p>The front page was filled with politics. A major decided to rebuild delapidated fishing ports that took damage during the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Some Liberal Democratic Party members are suspected to have relations to the Unification Church, etc. I thought that it's a kind of paper elderly people would be interested in. </p>
<p>Then two advertisment leaflets fell out of the paper. One was from a real estate agency. A picture of a young newly-wed smiling couple about to get their starter home. The ad also invites you to their lecture that "お金 ⋯ に関する疑問や不安の解消に役立ちます。[will help you to resolve doubts and worries about money (and other things.)]" That's a pretty straightforward way to go about it!</p>
<p>Another leaflet is offering... a place at a cemetery! Among other great things about this new cemetery at Nantoka-Megane Bridge is that it's 好評 [receiving favorable reviews.] Make sure ti grab your spot for only 180,000 yen! (50 years cemetery usage fee is included; you can store up to 2 霊 [souls] in one spot.)</p>
<p>After the initial "what a clever way to people's money out of them!" response I remembered that I had an impression that it's mostly elderly people who would read a paper like Kahoku-shimpō. Then I saw it: a 70 year old gentleman is sitting in his tatami-floored living room. From the kitchen, where his wife is cooking dinner, the sounds of a TV news program can be heard. He puts down his hand fan when the cemetery ad falls out of the newspaper. He starts thinking. Here they offer to pray for your after-death happines for long years. The cemetery looks pleasantly sunlit under the watch of a marble statue of a buddhist god and next to a little grove. What is mere 180,000 yen comparing to a good place where one will stay for eternity? The ad says it's up to the client to pick the desired Buddhist sect. It also states that "生前のお申込みも受け付けています。[applications from the yet-alive are accepted.]"</p>
<p>The gentleman picks up his hand fan, unfolds it it and looks at the other-wordly luminiscent light at the ceiling. He thinks, then nods a couple of times. When he looks back at the ad, he can almost see his family name at the picture of a sample tombstone that says "Your name here."</p>
